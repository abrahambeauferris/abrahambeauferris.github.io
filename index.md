## Experience

### Associate Engineer | Huawei Canada, Vancouver Research Center  
_August 2022 - Present_

At Huawei, I contribute to the Cloud Rendering team where I work on advancing real-time photorealistic imagery. My role includes:
- Developing material creation tools within Open 3D Engine.
- Implementing and optimizing physically-based rendering techniques.
- Working with ray tracing algorithms to enhance game development and rendering efficiency.
- Exploring AI algorithms to improve performance and realism in graphics.

### Undergraduate Researcher | VISAGG, University of Calgary  
_September 2021 - May 2022_

I collaborated on the **SurgiSim** project, a VR platform designed to teach otolaryngology through immersive simulations. I contributed to graphical enhancements and helped improve performance through rendering techniques like directional ambient occlusion.

## Projects

### Deep Albedo: A Spatially Aware Autoencoder Approach to Interactive Human Skin Rendering  
_C++, Python, OpenCV, UE5_

This research project focused on using **Monte Carlo photon simulations** and **neural autoencoders** to simulate human skin color in real-time. The goal was to create a model that could dynamically change based on biophysical parameters. This project was presented at SIGGRAPH Asia 2023.

### Enhancing the Graphical Fidelity of the SurgiSim Platform  
_Unreal Engine 4, C++_

For my honours research, I enhanced the visual fidelity of the SurgiSim VR platform. I implemented **directional ambient occlusion** and **subsurface scattering** to increase realism. Additionally, I improved the performance using **dynamic resolution scaling**, ensuring the system could run smoothly under demanding conditions.
